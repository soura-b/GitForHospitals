# GitForHospitals
How can we use GitHub for patient records in a hospital? Some ideas and examples have been presented here.

# Motivation
With second wave of COVID burning through India, many organization are responding by setting by hospitals. I learnt about one such organization, Doctors for You (https://doctorsforyou.org/), which has - as on May 09 2021 - set up 16 COVID hospitals.

These hospitals require the following:
1. Supply chain management - for drugs
2. Personnel management - for doctors, nurses and paramedics
3. Bed allocation - these hospitals are inpatient care facilities
4. Patient tracking - admission, treatment and discharge

This post seeks to address items 3 and 4.

# Approach
Use GitHub issues to track

Sample hospital with 10 beds - 5 in a male ward (green), and 5 in a female ward (blue).
